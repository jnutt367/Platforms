        <h3>We should have an animated Large Green Circle floating across the top on the next commit...</h3>
        <h3>The ball should bounce off the right wall but not until it reaches the center of its radius...</h3>
        <h3>At this commit the ball bounces off wall and center radius accounted for to create effect of bouncing yay!</h3>
        <h3>So, the ball should bounce from side to side in constant motion at this commit</h3>
        <h3>Ball is now aware of both x and y canvas borders and bounces within these borders. I AM animating Yay!</h3>
        <h3>Commit will randomize the beginning x and y coordinates for the now black circle...</h3>
