        <h2>Here is the ongoing mini canvas project I'm using to Learn Git What a BlaST!!</h2>
        <h3>Check: We should have an animated Large Green Circle floating across the top on the next commit...</h3>
        <h3>Check: The ball should bounce off the right wall but not until it reaches the center of its radius...</h3>
        <h3>Check: At this commit the ball bounces off wall and center radius accounted for to create effect of bouncing yay!</h3>
        <h3>Check: So, the ball should bounce from side to side in constant motion at this commit</h3>
        <h3>Check: Ball is now aware of both x and y canvas borders and bounces within these borders. I AM animating Yay!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Commit will randomize the beginning x and y coordinates for the now black circle...</h3>
        <h3>Check: OH and the circle is now half it's former diameter Bam and BOOM!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Randmized the velocity of x and y (Math.random()) , so the circle goes at random speeds .... whaaat?!!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Instantiated a Circle object and then realized it was beig refreshed over with the animate() function...</h3>
        <h3>Check: So I went ahead and called the new circle.draw() method inside the animate function so you can see both...</h3>
        <h2>Current: Using update function and this.keyword producing ramndomly placed static circle object and bouncing small circle...</h2>
