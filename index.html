        <h2>Here is the on going mini canvas project I'm using to Learn Git What a BlaST!!</h2>
        <h3>Check: Learned how to create and draw squares lines and circles....</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned how to resize and position shapes and lines with starting x and y coordinates...</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned how to move drawings and start animating objects...</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned how to randomize starting positions of shapes and account for velocity and radius...!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned to create bounce illusion by including center radius of bouncing ball...</h3>
        <h3>Check: Ball is now aware of both x and y canvas borders and bounces within these borders. I AM animating Yay!</h3>
        <h3>Check: OH and the circle is now half it's former diameter Bam and BOOM!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned circle velocity of x and y can be randmized (Math.random()) , so the circle goes at random speeds .... whaaat?!!</h3>
        <h3>Check: Learned to Instantiate a Circle object and then realized it was being refreshed over with the animate() function...</h3>
        <h3>Check: So I went ahead and called the new circle.draw() method inside the animate function so you can see both...</h3>
        <h3>Check: Using update function and this.keyword producing ramndomly placed static circle object and bouncing small circle...</h3>
        <h3>Check: bg to black>>> one stactic one floating and boucing>>></h3>
        <h2>Current: Practicing with loops and nested functions and arrays to create these bouncing randomized velocity "Space Balls" Eh-hem..If you will lol</h2>
